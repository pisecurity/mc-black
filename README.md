# Overview

`mc-black` is a simplified, standalone version of black color theme for Midnight Commander.

It supports only Debian/Ubuntu Linux distributions (and their clones, eg. Raspbian/Armbian/Devuan/Mint), with new config paths scheme, eg. Debian/Raspbian since Wheezy, Ubuntu since 12.04 LTS and so on.

It doesn't support BSD systems, and RHEL/SuSE Linux. If you look for version that supports all possible distributions, please use https://github.com/serverfarmer/sf-mc-black instead.
